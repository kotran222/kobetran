Still need to address the issue in the navigation side menu. When it is clicked on, it won't display directory window. 

small issue with home and footer on mobile. 
    maybe need to delete image at certain height
    adjust pdf and contact form so they fit better on phone screen so footer is adjusted appropriately?
